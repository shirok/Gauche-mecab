	* mecab-lib.scm (make-mecab): Let the constructor return #f if
	  initialization failed.  Recent MeCab doesn't alway set error
	  messages, so the caller should rely on the return value.
	* test.scm: Tweaked to follow some subtle changes in libmecab.

	* Fixed some trivial argument mismatch bugs, revealed by recent
	  Gauche test.

	* Merged naoya_t's mecab-gauche-0.98pre1 (http://blog.livedoor.jp/naoya_t/archives/51131440.html)
	* Supports:
		* Tagger class
		* Accessors for mecab_node_t structure members
		* All MeCab APIs, except those which overwrite their argument:
		    mecab-sparse-tostr3, mecab-nbest-sparse-tostr3, mecab-nbest-next-tostr2
	* (mecab params ...) makes a new instance with parameter(s).  The format is inspired by leque's (make-mecab :rcfile "mymecabrc") style.
	* Separates dictionary-dependent tests from test.scm.

	* Picked up development to make use of it.   Adapted to the newer
	  way of stub writing.   NOTE: you need Gauche svn trunk to compile
	  this.
